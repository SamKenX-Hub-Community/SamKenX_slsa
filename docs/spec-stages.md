Specifications go through various stages of development from which you
should have different expectations. This document defines the different
stages the SLSA project uses and their meaning for readers and
contributors.

Every specification page should prominently display a *Status* section
stating which stage the specification is in with a link to its
definition.

## Working Draft

This is the first stage of development a specification goes
through. At this point, not much should be expected of it. The
specification may be very incomplete and may change at any time and
even be abandoned. It is therefore not suitable for reference or for
implementation beyond experimentation.

A specification may be published several times during this stage as
work progresses. The status section of the document may provide
additional information as to its development status and whether
reviews and feedback are welcome.

## In Review

At this stage the document is considered to be feature complete and is
published as a way to invite final reviews. Editorial changes may
still be made but no addition of new features is expected and short of
problems being found no significant changes are expected to happen
anymore.

## Stable

At this stage the document is considered stable. No changes that would
constitute a significant departure from the existing specification are
expected although changes to address ambiguities and edge cases may
still occur.

## Retired

This stage indicates that the specification is no longer maintained.
It has been either rendered obsolete by a newer version or
abandoned for some reason. The status of the document may provide
additional information and point to the new document to use intead if
there is one.
